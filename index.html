        <h2>About the Company</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>JBVILLAREAL ENTERPRISES</strong> is a company engaged in the supply and installation of construction materials, specializing in long span colored G.I. roofing materials and insulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company was established in 1997 under the name ‘VMVillareal Trading’, with the primary purpose of providing quality construction materials and efficient and reliable service. Humbly beginning with only three staff members, the fast and quality of work delivered to our early clients saw this small company grow its reputation and trustworthiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company is now registered with the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS). The owner and founder envisions the Philippines as one of the most highly industrialized countries in Asia. With this, he also envisions that the company will play a major role in providing the infrastructure needs of both government and private sector in the coming years.
